              One of the first decisions you'll make when buying a home is whether to choose new construction or a resale property. Both options have distinct advantages, and the right choice depends on your priorities, timeline, budget, and lifestyle preferences. As a buyer's agent specializing in new construction, I help clients understand the trade-offs and make informed decisions.

              New Construction: The Advantages
            </h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Modern Design and Layouts
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              New construction homes feature contemporary floor plans designed for today's lifestyles. Open-concept layouts, larger kitchens, and flexible spaces are standard. At Sierra at Skyeview Homes, you'll find modern two-story designs with 1,602 to 1,965 square feet, featuring open-concept layouts that maximize space and natural light.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Latest Technology and Energy Efficiency
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              New homes come with integrated smart home technology, energy-efficient appliances, and modern building materials that reduce utility costs. At Sierra at Skyeview Homes, every home includes smart home technology and energy-efficient features as standard, helping you save money on monthly utilities.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Customization Opportunities
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              With new construction, you can often customize finishes, fixtures, and upgrades during the design phase. This allows you to create a home that reflects your personal style and needs, rather than working with someone else's choices.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Warranty Protection
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              New construction homes come with builder warranties covering structural defects, major systems, and workmanship. This provides peace of mind and protection against unexpected repair costs in the first few years of ownership.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Lower Maintenance Costs
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Everything in a new home is brand new, meaning you won't face immediate repairs or replacements. Roofs, HVAC systems, appliances, and plumbing are all new and under warranty, reducing maintenance expenses in the early years.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Master-Planned Community Benefits
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              New construction communities like Skye Canyon offer master-planned amenities including parks, pools, trails, and community centers. These amenities are designed and built as part of the community vision, ensuring cohesive design and quality.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              New Construction: The Considerations
            </h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Construction Timeline
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              New construction requires time—typically 4-6 months from contract to completion. If you need to move immediately, you may need to consider quick move-in homes or temporary housing. However, Sierra at Skyeview Homes offers quick move-in options for buyers who need faster occupancy.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Less Negotiation Room
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              While there's still room to negotiate incentives and upgrades, new construction pricing is typically less flexible than resale properties. However, builders may offer closing cost credits, design center credits, or other incentives that add value.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Community Development
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              New communities may still be under construction, which means ongoing construction activity and evolving neighborhood character. However, this also means you're getting in early and can watch the community develop.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              Resale Properties: The Advantages
            </h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Immediate Availability
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Resale homes are available immediately. You can move in as soon as closing is complete, making them ideal for buyers with urgent timelines or those who need to relocate quickly.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Established Neighborhoods
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Resale properties are in established neighborhoods with mature landscaping, settled communities, and proven track records. You can see exactly what the neighborhood looks like and how it's developed over time.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              More Negotiation Flexibility
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Resale properties often offer more room for price negotiation, especially if the home has been on the market for a while or needs updates. Sellers may be more motivated to negotiate on price, closing costs, or repairs.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Character and Charm
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Older homes may have unique architectural features, mature trees, and established character that new construction can't replicate. If you appreciate vintage details and historic charm, resale properties may appeal to you.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Lower Initial Cost
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Resale properties may have lower initial purchase prices, especially if they need updates or are in less desirable locations. However, factor in the cost of repairs, updates, and renovations when comparing total costs.
            </p>

              Immediate Repairs and Updates
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Resale homes may need immediate repairs, updates, or renovations. Roofs, HVAC systems, appliances, and finishes may be nearing the end of their useful life, requiring replacement or significant maintenance.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Outdated Features and Layouts
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Older homes may have outdated floor plans, smaller kitchens, fewer bathrooms, or less storage space. Updating these features can be expensive and disruptive.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Higher Utility Costs
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Older homes typically have less efficient HVAC systems, insulation, and appliances, leading to higher monthly utility costs. Upgrading to energy-efficient systems requires significant investment.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Limited Warranty Protection
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Resale properties typically come "as-is" with limited warranty protection. You'll need to rely on inspections to identify issues, and you'll be responsible for repairs after closing.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              Potential for Hidden Issues
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Older homes may have hidden issues like foundation problems, outdated electrical systems, or plumbing issues that aren't immediately apparent. Thorough inspections are crucial.
            </p>
